## Summary
Content is King, especially in the adult entertainment industry, but rewards are also extremely important! That’s why we want to present to the SWAG community with the opportunity to provide rewards via a bounty program to users that attract/create outstanding content.

## Abstract
A vote to decide if SWAG should set up a bounty program that invites/rewards assistance from the community for attracting talent and developing content?
Motivation

## Motivation
Our reasoning is simple: It will help attract great talent and keep them and our current users/members more engage in our community. It will help kickstart even more creative ways to interact with SWAG content and it will be a great way to measure what our community likes.

**FOR**: We should set up a bounty program to invite/reward assistance from the community for attracting talent and developing content.

**AGAINST**: No, we should not set up a bounty program to invite/reward assistance from the community for attracting talent and developing content.
