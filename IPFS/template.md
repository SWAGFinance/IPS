## Summary
Swag.Live is growing at an exponential rate and we want our users, platform, and stakeholders to grow with it in order to maintain our level of outstanding performance. In order to do that we want to actively find amazing talent that understands our background and that can act as bridges for Swag.Live to new users, markets, and regions.

## Abstract
A vote to decide if Swag.Live should invest in attracting English speaking Asian talent?

## Motivation
Swag.Live is the best porn platform in Asia. Our reach is growing and we want to grow by adopting new regions, but without losing our own touch. Investing in Asian English-speaking talent would be the perfect way to connect our two goals and start exporting our own brand of immersive porn experience!

**FOR**: Yes, we should invest in attracting English-speaking Asian talent.

**AGAINST**: No, we should not invest in attracting English-speaking Asian talent.
