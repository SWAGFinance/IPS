## Simple Summary

The current governance ecosystem can be intimidating and passive due to the requirement of high domain knowledge. In order for the SWAG community to be more active and engaged, a good practice we will adopt is to host regular voting sessions called SQUIRTS. By participating in a SQUIRT, governance members will be rewarded for their participation and their efforts. The first proposal will be around the duration and frequency of SQUIRTS.

## Abstract
Come to a consensus on the frequency of SQUIRT governance sessions.

## Motivation
We hope to increase interaction with our community and the community membersâ€™ participation in the DAO. As SWAG governance token holders participating in the SQUIRTS, you will be rewarded for your time and effort. A strong show of participation will also send the right public signals - SWAG is an active and sustainable community.
It is therefore important to come to a consensus on how often SQUIRTS should be conducted. If they are held infrequently, governance members might lose interest. If they are held too frequently, there may be proposals which do not bring much value to the community and will also eventually result in loss of interest from governance token holders. 


**FOR**: Conduct SQUIRTS on a weekly basis

**AGAINST**: Conduct SQUIRTS on a biweekly basis
