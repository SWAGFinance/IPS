## Summary
The two common business practices for content platforms are freemium and paid-premium models. SWAG has been a profitable business because it adopted the paid-premium model. However, giants like YouTube/Pornhub gained their popularity and traffic via freemium model. SWAG would like feedback from the DAO on whether Swag should risk profitability in order to engage a larger traffic pool?

## Abstract
Discuss the possibility of providing freemium service on SWAG.

## Motivation
SWAG has more than 10 million viewers, and is growing steadily day by day. SWAG has always maintained a paid-premium business model and SWAG generates over $12 million in EBITDA a year. Although highly profitable, the paid-premium model necessarily sacrifices speed of growth for profitability. The Adult streaming market is dominated by Freemium platforms like Pornhub, XVIDEO, that generate traffic of over 95 million viewers per day. SWAG, while currently highly profitable, could change their revenue strategy to a freemium model to push viewer growth. Chasing this growth would have the possibility of impacting current profitability for the promise of increased growth trajectory. New pricing or access models could affect the current monetized customer base and outcomes of transferring to an ad driven are uncertain. However should the change over be successful SWAG would be positioned to dominate the Asian Adult video market with a massive population base. Based on these risks and rewards, should Swag sacrifice monetary gains in order to engage a larger traffic pool?

**FOR**: Explore the freemium model and receive revenue streams via advertisement.

**AGAINST**: Stay with the current paid-premium model.
