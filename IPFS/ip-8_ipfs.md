## Summary
Due to a recent attack, SWAG NGTH called an emergency meeting. The decision reached was to release locked $Swag tokens and inject them into Cream to prevent further attacks and price dump. The community voted through Squirt 6 to use the original Squirt 6 USDC rewards for a buyback program to stimulate the market. The proposal passed, and the rewards were used to buyback $Swag tokens. In the DAO spirit, we would like to hear from our community via an 8th Squirt to decide what to do with the tokens we bought back.

## Abstract
The following proposal is to decide what to do with the tokens we bought back as a result of our 6th squirt rewards.

## Motivation
A recent attack forced the SWAG NGTH to conduct an urgent meeting to organize a response to protect the $SWAG token. Using SQUIRTs, the community agreed to run a buyback program. The DAO has decided to share the token address used for the buyback to continue to foster transparency within our community.

Buyback address:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x8C9A6839589a4c14C1513d0E03BC261AB7662e42

For Squirt 8, we will be voting on the next steps for the tokens from the buyback:
The two options are as follow:
Option 1: Burn the $Swag tokens.
Option 2: Airdrop the $Swag tokens. 

By burning the tokens, the total circulating amount will be reduced; therefore, this action could pump $Swag's price. The Squirt USDC rewards used to execute the buyback are considered part of the community, so the community can also vote in favor of a SWAG token airdrop to the current $Swag token holder community.

**FOR**: Burn these buyback tokens

**AGAINST**: Airdrop these buyback tokens to the community
