## Summary
At SWAG our goal is to create more than a product, our goal is to create a collection of streamlined services that provide an outstanding experience for our users. Thatâ€™s why we are now considering the idea of incorporating SWAG diamonds into our staking options. Giving users more versatility with their diamonds.


## Abstract
A vote to decide if we should incorporate diamonds directly into our staking options.

## Motivation
Our users are currently accumulating diamonds in order to purchase content in Swag.live. They can earn diamonds by holding $SWAG and by participating in our weekly Squirts or daily Diamond Drips. In order to make our diamonds an ubiquitous unit within SWAG we want to empower our users to use their diamonds directly into future staking options.


**FOR**: We should incorporate diamonds into our staking options.

**AGAINST**: No, we should not incorporate diamonds into our staking options.
