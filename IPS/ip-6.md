## Summary
Starting in October, the team began utilizing CREAM borrowing with SWAG to capitalize on China’s business expansion. Capital to fuel growth in the Chinese region is impossible to support through traditional banking due to the region’s political situation therefore, CREAM is a perfect solution for borrowing since the income will far exceed the interest needed to cover the loans.

## Abstract
Should DAO utilize next week’s 250,000 USDC to buy back SWAG tokens from open market?

## Motivation
Malicious attackers targeted 11/15 at approximately 3 AM UTC=8 to begin purposely devaluing $SWAG. The attackers began intentionally dumping the price of SWAG to profit on shorting and price arbitrage. Since the attacks started, Coin Gecko has been misreporting the price as there has been a significant difference in pricing in different platforms. Current liquidity is very light, and the price could be recovered; however, recovery has no value when the attacker is still active. In this situation The DAO will like advice from the community for an emergency action to support the price of SWAG by executing a buyback which could potentially recover the price.

**FOR**: Yes, execute the buyback

**AGAINST**: No, do not execute the buyback
