## Summary
As a leading adult content platform, SWAG.Live has been discussing whether or not to accept cryptocurrency as payment. Cryptocurrencies have been slow to achieve wide spread adoption as a payment method due to large price fluctuations, however ,with continued growth in use cases and user base it has become an increasingly popular method of payment. Since SWAG.live has entered the crypto currency space more crypto native users have been joining the site, making a crypto payment option an attractive addition to their existing system. Therefore the DAO has decided to ask whether SWAG.Live should accept cryptocurrency to attract more users from the crypto space?

## Abstract
Discuss whether or not SWAG.Live should accept cryptocurrency as a payment method.

## Motivation
Although some online platforms accept cryptocurrency payments, in the past, cryptocurrencies have been slow to achieve widespread adoption. This year however, payment giant PayPal announced news that it will open crypto-services, reflecting the rising trend of global cryptocurrency payment adoption.  As a leading adult content platform, SWAG.Live has been discussing whether or not to accept cryptocurrencies as a first step towards full crypto integration. 
With crypto currencies accepted as a payment method SWAG.live could also take additional steps to join with the crypto community such as integrating Binance Access to allow users to purchase crypto seamlessly on the site along with deeper integrations of $SWAG within the site itself. Currently, SWAG.Live supports up to 12 kinds of fiat currencies, and credit card payments that can be used worldwide. Do you think SWAG.Live should develop the feature to accept cryptocurrency? Please discuss the pros and cons of this matter in detail in the new Discord channel.

**FOR**: SWAG should accept cryptocurrency
