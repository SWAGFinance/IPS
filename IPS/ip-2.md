CEX are centralized exchanges. Examples include Binance and FTX. How aggressively should we pursue CEX listings? Considering the process of listing on CEX is usually more costly and time consuming, compared to DEX?
Note: DEX means decentralized exchange.

## Summary
Listing on CEX costs time and money. Listing on DEX costs much less time and money. However, CEX have more mainstream adoption at this time, compared to DEX, which opens up the project to more “eyeballs”. Should we devote time and resources to aggressively pursue listings on centralized exchanges?

## Abstract
Discuss devoting significant time and resources to pursue CEX listings.

## Motivation
One metric in any project’s measure of success, is the number of people who have heard about it and are vested in it. Centralized exchanges (CEX) have been the primary way of transacting in the space for most of the crypto audience. While decentralized exchanges (DEX) have gained significant traction in the recent months, they are still considered less mainstream than CEX. Listing on CEX will help increase the exposure that SWAG Finance gets and bring on larger communities. However, the process of listing on a CEX is usually time consuming and requires a lot of effort from teams. It is not uncommon for team members to drop everything they’re working on to focus on communicating with CEX. Other priorities on the roadmap get shifted back. Based on these give and takes, should SWAG Finance focus team’s time and full effort in the near term on getting listed on CEX?

**FOR**: Focus time and effort on CEX listing

**AGAINST**: Focus time and effort on building out roadmap e.g. migration onchain, rather than pursue CEX listing
