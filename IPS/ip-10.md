## Summary
The SWAG team just launched an updated version of our website (check it out swag.finance), and for that reason, we purchased the swagproject.co domain since we feel it more accurately depicts what our DeFi token project is about. Our idea is to use that domain and rebrand the website with a fresh look before the year ends.

## Abstract
A vote to decide if we should rebrand from Swag.finance to swagproject.co

## Motivation
We are growing, and we want to make sure our brand reflects it. As the largest adult entertainment company in Asia, we know our position in the DeFi industry is unique, and we want our brand to look that way. The SWAG team just launched an updated version of our website (check it out swag.finance), and for that reason, we purchased the swagproject.co
domain since we feel it more accurately depicts what our DeFi token project is about. Our idea is to use that domain and rebrand the website with a fresh look before the year ends.

**FOR**: We should rebrand to swagproject.co

**AGAINST**: SWAG should keep its domain name as swag.finance
