## Summary
Based on the recent attacks SWAG NGTH convened urgent meeting to organize a response and protect $SWAG. A massive whale was found to be preparing and executing a long term predatory attack campaign with 200m USDC in their arsenal.

## Abstract
An emergency SQUIRT vote is called which will start immediately, and will last for 60 minutes. If the vote passes, 3 tranches of NGTH and CBM will be distributed and NGTH will use the tranches to shore up our defenses.

## Motivation

In response CREAM lending community will complete its vote in the next few hours to reduce SWAG collateral down to an aggressively low Collateral Factor further jeopardizing the project. The existing loans on CREAM were not collateralized enough to resist this kind of attack.

Given the above, we have decided to vote the following:
Remaining NGTH and CBMs tokens were planned to be distributed across 7 tranches across next 7 months (Dec 15, 2020 to Jun 15, 2021) The vote will be to fast track 3 tranches (Apr 15, 2021 + May 15, 2021 + Jun 15, 2021) and release it with immediate effect to all NGTH and CBM holders.
NGTH tokens will commit the released SWAG to increasing projectâ€™s collateralized base, and shore up defenses against short attacks.
An emergency SQUIRT vote is called which will start immediately, and will last for 60 minutes. If the vote passes, 3 tranches of NGTH and CBM will be distributed and NGTH will use the tranches to shore up our defenses.
Today, the project must defended itself aggressively but we cannot do this ourselves. Since inception a month ago, we have distributed close to 1m USDC in SQUIRT values to all members of the community who have contributed through our SQUIRT votes. This month, November 2020, we expect to achieve ATH profits for our adult entertainment business globally. We WILL defend our project but we need to support of our partners and community whom we have counted on in the past.

**FOR**: Agree to release

**AGAINST**: Disagree to release
