## Summary
With the community voting FOR SWAG.Live to expand its presence in China, marketing in China will be one of the main future challenges. Adult platforms in China are usually operated in secrecy and shared among users via word of mouth. To expand the user base quickly in China, Freemium model could be the proper strategy. On the other hand, current revenues from unlocking videos make up for 30~40% of the total revenue on SWAG. The community should discuss the potential revenue models SWAG.Live could explore when for expanding its base in China.

## Abstract
Discuss whether or not SWAG.Live China should provide free videos (Freemium Model)

## Motivation
China has strict policies on adult content websites, making it difficult to do marketing publicly. The majority of the videos are shared among porn-viewers via WeChat groups. SWAG.Live has advanced technology that prevents users from pirating and sharing videos illegally and outside the platform. SWAG.Live invests heavily in this technology because SWAG believes the rights and earnings of Swaggers, who put in lots of effort and should be compensated for their work. The paid videos model make up for 30~40% of the total SWAG.Live revenue. By providing free SWAG videos in China, SWAG.Live will most likely accumulate many users in a short period of time. However, the piracy issue will definitely arise, and videos will be leaked outside of China, affecting the Swaggers compensation. Do you think SWAG.Live should use a freemium model in China?
