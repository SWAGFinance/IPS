## Summary
Although SWAG.Live has not yet officially entered the China market, SWAG already has a strong presence among the Chinese porn community. In order to successfully capitalize on the massive potential of the China market, SWAG would need to invest in establishing a sustainable operation model to serve the Chinese market.

## Abstract
Discuss whether or not SWAG should develop their presence China market.

## Motivation
Out of China’s population of 1.4 billion, there are nearly 700 million males. The number is staggering, and there are lots of porn-thirsty eyes to be fed. In recent years Mainland China has become one of the world’s largest consumer markets for online porn. Due to the strict pornography laws in China, foreign providers must constantly adapt to censorship and repression by the government regulators. Foreign porn websites are constantly being blocked by the Great Fire Wall of China, and few operators are willing to continuously play the Cat & Mouse game. SWAG.Live has not yet officially entered the mainland China market, but with the strong brand name, SWAG has already been able to acquire users quickly. If SWAG is to move forward to fully penetrate (pun intended) the mainland China market, SWAG will need to allocate more resources to this expansion, as well needing assistance from the SWAG Finance community at large.

**FOR**: SWAG should develop the Chinese market

**AGAINST**: SWAG shouldn’t develop the Chinese market
