## Summary
SWAG operates the world’s leading Asian adult platform. Over the last 4+ years, SWAG has amassed a community made up of tens of millions of users, entertained by tens of thousands of adult entertainers with millions of hours of adult content. Yet, there are many crucial new business opportunities for SWAG to pursue. For example: expanding into new countries and territories, exploring new media platforms, creating partnerships with other media and business entities. We are considering creating a Rewards Campaign to incentivize users to support these new business initiatives. Users would be rewarded with SWAG for participating in the process to achieve our business expansion goals.  


## Abstract
A vote to decide if SWAG should initiate a Rewards Campaign to support our business expansion initiatives.

## Motivation
Expanding SWAG’s core business would benefit all stakeholders, including SWAG token holders. Incentivizing users with a Rewards Campaign would allow SWAG token holders to participate in and potentially benefit from this process.


**FOR**: We should initiate a Rewards Campaign.

**AGAINST**: No, we should not initiate a Rewards Campaign.
