<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final IP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new IP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a 
  <code>discussions</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the IP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your IP is mature and ready to progress past the DRIP phase, you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance meeting where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the IP editors will update the state of your IP to 
  <code>Approved</code>.
