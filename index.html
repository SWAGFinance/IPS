<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final SWIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new SWIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a 
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the SWIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your SWIP is mature and ready to progress past the DRIP phase, you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance meeting where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the SWIP editors will update the state of your SWIP to 
  <code>Approved</code>.
